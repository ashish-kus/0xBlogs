Welcome to the source code for my personal technical blog, built with Hugo. This repository contains all the content, configuration, and theme files used to generate the site.

## About the Blog

This is where I document my journey and learnings as a dedicated software developer. My posts focus heavily on crafting efficient systems and mastering the tools that empower productivity:

- Linux & CLI: Deep dives into the command line and optimizing workflows with Vim.

- DevOps & Cloud: Practical insights into automation, infrastructure, and modern cloud engineering.

- Systems Programming: Exploring robust, performance-focused solutions, particularly using C++.

My goal is to share knowledge rooted in efficiency, inspired by my background in mathematics and physics.
