# Introduction

Why wrestle with messy setups when you can box your app, ship it anywhere, and sip tea while it just works? No more “it works on my machine” excuses. Let’s breeze through Docker—no deep dives, just the good stuff.

Modern applications are no longer simple. They rely on specific versions of libraries, frameworks, and configurations to run correctly. Setting up an application on one machine and then trying to run it on another often leads to the classic “it works on my machine” problem, frustrating both developers and operations teams.

This is where Docker comes to the rescue. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers, which include everything the application needs to run—code, libraries, system tools, and runtime. By using Docker, applications can be deployed quickly and consistently across any environment, making scaling easier and ensuring that the code runs reliably every time.

## What is Containers ?

Containers are a technology that allow applications to be packaged and isolated with their entire runtime environment. This makes it easier to maintain consistent behavior and functionality while moving the contained application between environments (dev, test, production) and across public, private, hybrid cloud, and on-premise. Because they are lightweight and portable, containers provide opportunities for faster development and meeting business needs as they arise.

![Docker vs Container](/images/3.1.1.png)

Bare-metal/VM Provides full isolation and a complete OS, but is heavier, slower to start, and harder to scaling where as container is lightweight, fast to start, and easily scalable, making it ideal for DevOps pipelines and micro-services.

> **Note:**  
> Virtual Machines (VMs) provide strong isolation and security because each VM runs a full OS, making it harder for one VM to affect another. Containers, on the other hand, share the host OS kernel, so while they are lightweight and fast, their isolation is weaker, and extra security measures are often needed.

## What is Docker ?

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers. Docker is a way to build and run those containers, save them into templates etc.

- **Docker** = the tool/platform to build, ship, and manage containers.
- **Docker Image** = a read-only blueprint that contains everything needed to create a container, including code, libraries, and dependencies.
- **Container** = a running instance of a Docker image; an isolated, portable environment where your application actually runs.

## Open Container Initiative (OCI)

The OCI is an industry collaboration that aims to create open standards for container formats. It was founded by companies like Docker, Google, VMware, Microsoft, Dell, IBM, and Oracle. The OCI defines three primary specifications:

- Image Specification: Defines the image's metadata and format, including a serializable file system.
- Runtime Specification: Describes how to run a container using an image adhering to the Image Specification.
- Distribution Specification: Outlines how images should be distributed, such as through registries, pushing, and pulling images.

## Building Blocks

### Linux namespaces

Namespaces are a Linux kernel feature that partitions system resources so that one group of processes sees one set of resources, while another group sees a different set. This is achieved by assigning processes and resources to namespaces—each namespace provides an isolated view, even though they exist on the same system.

In general terms, a namespace is a container for commands and variables. It ensures that the commands and variables inside it do not conflict with those in other namespaces.

For example, in Tcl, there has always been a default namespace called the global namespace. It stores all global variables and commands. New namespaces can be created using the namespace eval command, allowing for better organization and isolation of variables and commands.

#### Some namespace-related commands

```bash

lsns  # List all namespaces on the system.

ls -l /proc/1/ns # Check namespaces attached to a specific process (e.g., PID 1).

unshare -p -f --mount-proc bash # Start a new shell with a new PID namespace.

unshare -p -u -m -f --mount-proc bash # Combine multiple namespaces (PID, UTS, mount).

ip netns add testns # Create network Namespaces

unshare -U -r bash #Map a non-root user ro root inside the namespaces.

```

```bash

# The namespace eval command lets you create new namespaces.
namespace eval Counter {
                  namespace export bump
                  variable num 0

                  proc bump {} {
                      variable num
                      incr num
                  }
              }

```

```bash

namespace eval Counter {
    variable num 0
    proc bump {} {
        variable num
        return [incr num]
    }
}
namespace eval Counter {
    proc test {args} {
        return $args
    }
}
namespace eval Counter {
      rename test ""
}

```

Note that the test procedure is added to the Counter namespace, and later removed via the rename command.

## Installation of Docker

Docker can be installed on a variety of operating systems, and the installation process differs slightly depending on your platform. On Arch Linux, Docker is available directly from the official repositories. You can install it using the following commands:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu docker
sudo systemctl enable --now docker

```

On Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions, Docker provides an official installation script or repository-based installation method, which ensures you get the latest stable version of Docker.
For Windows and macOS, Docker provides Docker Desktop, a complete package that includes the Docker engine, Docker CLI, and Docker Compose. Installing Docker Desktop is as simple as downloading the installer from the official Docker website and following the setup instructions. On Windows, Docker Desktop can use WSL2 to run Linux containers, while macOS uses a lightweight Linux VM under the hood.
