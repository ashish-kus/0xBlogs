# Docker CLI Cheat Sheet: Complete Reference Guide

## Container Lifecycle

### Run a container from an image

```bash
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND]
```

Creates and starts a container from a specified IMAGE. This is the primary command for getting a container up and running, allowing you to execute an optional COMMAND inside it.

### Run container in background

```bash
docker run -d IMAGE
```

Runs the container in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background. The command prints the container ID and exits the terminal, allowing you to continue using your shell.

### Run with interactive terminal

```bash
docker run -it IMAGE
```

Runs the container with an interactive terminal (`-i`) and allocates a pseudo-TTY (`-t`). This is essential for interacting with the container, like running an interactive shell such as bash.

### Run with custom name

```bash
docker run --name NAME IMAGE
```

Assigns a custom, human-readable NAME to the container instead of a randomly generated one. This makes it easier to reference the container in other Docker commands.

### Run with auto-remove on exit

```bash
docker run --rm IMAGE
```

Automatically removes the container's filesystem when it exits. This is useful for running temporary or short-lived jobs to keep your system clean.

### Create container without starting

```bash
docker create IMAGE
```

Creates a container from an image but does not start it. This allows you to configure the container or volume mounts before starting it manually with `docker start`.

### Start stopped container

```bash
docker start CONTAINER
```

Starts one or more existing, stopped containers. This is used to resume a container that was previously stopped without having to re-create it.

### Stop running container

```bash
docker stop CONTAINER
```

Gracefully shuts down a running container by sending a SIGTERM signal. Docker waits for a default timeout (usually 10 seconds) for the container to exit before sending a SIGKILL.

### Restart container

```bash
docker restart CONTAINER
```

Stops a running container and then starts it again. This is a convenient way to apply changes or simply recycle a container's processes.

### Pause container processes

```bash
docker pause CONTAINER
```

Suspends all processes inside one or more running containers. It achieves this by using the cgroups freezer to temporarily stop the container's execution.

### Unpause container

```bash
docker unpause CONTAINER
```

Resumes all processes inside a paused container. This reverses the effect of the `docker pause` command, allowing the container's processes to continue execution.

### Kill container immediately

```bash
docker kill CONTAINER
```

Immediately stops a container's execution by sending a SIGKILL signal. This should be used when a container is unresponsive to the gentler `docker stop` command.

### Remove stopped container

```bash
docker rm CONTAINER
```

Removes one or more stopped containers. It cannot remove a running container unless the `-f` (force) flag is used.

### Force remove running container

```bash
docker rm -f CONTAINER
```

Forces the removal of a container, even if it is currently running. This is an abrupt removal that is equivalent to running `docker kill` followed by `docker rm`.

### Wait for container to stop

```bash
docker wait CONTAINER
```

Blocks the current shell execution until one or more containers stop. It then prints the container's exit codes, which is useful for scripting sequential operations.

### Rename container

```bash
docker rename OLD NEW
```

Changes the custom name of an existing container from OLD to NEW. This is a simple utility command for maintaining better organization of your containers.

### Update container resources

```bash
docker update [OPTIONS] CONTAINER
```

Allows for dynamic configuration updates to a running container's resource constraints. You can use it to change limits like memory (`-m`) or CPU shares.

---

## Container Information

### List running containers

```bash
docker ps
```

Displays a list of all currently running containers. It provides essential information like Container ID, Image, Status, and Ports.

### List all containers

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Displays a list of all containers, including those that are stopped or exited. This is the full inventory of containers present on your Docker host.

### Show container logs

```bash
docker logs CONTAINER
```

Retrieves the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) logs for a container. It shows the history of what the container's main process has written.

### Follow log output

```bash
docker logs -f CONTAINER
```

Streams the log output from a container in real-time. This is useful for monitoring the activity of a running service.

### Show container processes

```bash
docker top CONTAINER
```

Displays the running processes within a container. It's similar to the Linux `top` command but scoped to the container's environment.

### Show container stats

```bash
docker stats
```

Displays a live stream of resource usage statistics for all running containers. It includes CPU, memory usage, network I/O, and disk I/O.

### Show detailed container info

```bash
docker inspect CONTAINER
```

Returns low-level, detailed JSON configuration information about a container. This is a powerful command used for debugging and viewing all configuration details.

### Show container port mappings

```bash
docker port CONTAINER
```

Displays the public-facing port mapping for a container to its private ports. It quickly shows you which HOST ports are mapped to which CONTAINER ports.

### Show filesystem changes

```bash
docker diff CONTAINER
```

Displays the changes made to the container's filesystem since it was created. It indicates files that have been added (A), deleted (D), or modified (C).

---

## Container Interaction

### Execute command in container

```bash
docker exec CONTAINER COMMAND
```

Runs a new command inside an already running container. The original process of the container remains running.

### Open interactive shell

```bash
docker exec -it CONTAINER sh
```

Executes an interactive shell (like `sh` or `bash`) inside the container. This is the primary way to get a command prompt and debug inside a running service.

### Attach to running container

```bash
docker attach CONTAINER
```

Attaches your local standard input, output, and error streams to a running container's main process. This is generally used to view the real-time output or interact with a process that started interactively.

### Copy files from container

```bash
docker cp CONTAINER:SRC DEST
```

Copies files or folders from the container's filesystem at SRC to the local machine at DEST. This is a simple way to pull data out of a container.

### Copy files to container

```bash
docker cp SRC CONTAINER:DEST
```

Copies files or folders from the local machine at SRC into the container's filesystem at DEST. This is a quick utility for adding necessary files to a running container.

### Export container filesystem

```bash
docker export CONTAINER > file.tar
```

Exports the contents of a container's filesystem as a tar archive. It does not include the metadata or base image layers, just a flattened filesystem.

### Create image from container

```bash
docker commit CONTAINER IMAGE
```

Creates a new image by capturing the current state of a running or stopped container. This is typically a less-preferred method than using a Dockerfile but is useful for quick saves.

---

## Image Management

### List images

```bash
docker images
```

Displays a list of all locally stored Docker images. It provides the image repository, tag, ID, creation time, and size.

### List all images including dangling

```bash
docker images -a
```

Shows all local images, including intermediate images used during builds and "dangling" images (untagged, unused layers). This helps in identifying and cleaning up all image data.

### Pull image from registry

```bash
docker pull IMAGE[:TAG]
```

Downloads an image and its necessary layers from a registry, typically Docker Hub. If no TAG is specified, it defaults to the `:latest` tag.

### Push image to registry

```bash
docker push IMAGE[:TAG]
```

Uploads a local image and its layers to a configured registry (e.g., Docker Hub). The image must be appropriately tagged with the registry path before pushing.

### Remove image

```bash
docker rmi IMAGE
```

Removes one or more local images. An image cannot be removed if it is currently being used by any container.

### Force remove image

```bash
docker rmi -f IMAGE
```

Forces the removal of an image, even if it is currently in use by a container. It achieves this by also removing any references to the image.

### Tag image

```bash
docker tag SOURCE TARGET
```

Creates an alias for an image, giving it a new name and/or tag. This is most often used to prepare an image with a full registry path before pushing it.

### Show image history

```bash
docker history IMAGE
```

Displays the history of an image, showing each layer and the command used to create it. This is useful for understanding how an image was built and its size progression.

### Show detailed image info

```bash
docker inspect IMAGE
```

Returns low-level, detailed JSON configuration information about an image. It provides metadata, layer history, configuration, and image size details.

### Search Docker Hub

```bash
docker search TERM
```

Searches the public Docker Hub registry for images matching a specific TERM. This helps discover publicly available images to use as base images.

### Save image to tar

```bash
docker save IMAGE > file.tar
```

Saves one or more images into a tar archive. This is used for backing up an image or transferring it to a host that is offline (air-gapped).

### Load image from tar

```bash
docker load < file.tar
```

Loads a tar archive from standard input as a Docker image. This is the command used to import an image that was previously saved using `docker save`.

### Import filesystem as image

```bash
docker import file.tar IMAGE
```

Creates a new image from the contents of a tarball, using it as a flattened filesystem. Unlike `docker load`, this creates a single-layer, non-history image.

### Remove unused images

```bash
docker image prune
```

Removes all dangling images (untagged and unreferenced by any container). This is a basic housekeeping command to free up disk space.

### Remove all unused images

```bash
docker image prune -a
```

Removes all unused images, including both dangling and non-dangling ones not referenced by any container. Use this with caution as it removes any image not actively in use.

---

## Image Building

### Build image from Dockerfile

```bash
docker build -t NAME PATH
```

Builds a new Docker image using the Dockerfile located in the specified PATH (the build context). The `-t` flag tags the resulting image with a friendly NAME.

### Build with tag

```bash
docker build -t NAME:TAG PATH
```

Builds and tags the image with a specific NAME and TAG. This is the best practice for versioning your images.

### Build with custom Dockerfile

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t NAME PATH
```

Specifies an alternative path and file name for the Dockerfile to use for the build. This is necessary when the Dockerfile is not named `Dockerfile` or is not in the root of the build context.

### Build without cache

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t NAME PATH
```

Forces the builder to execute all steps without using any previously cached layers. This is useful when you suspect the cache is stale or you need a clean build.

### Build with build args

```bash
docker build --build-arg KEY=VALUE -t NAME PATH
```

Passes a build-time variable to the Dockerfile, which can be referenced via the ARG instruction. This is used to inject dynamic values like versions or credentials during the build.

### Build specific stage

```bash
docker build --target STAGE -t NAME PATH
```

Builds only up to the specified STAGE name in a multi-stage Dockerfile. This is essential for debugging intermediate stages or creating smaller "builder" images.

### Build for platform

```bash
docker build --platform PLATFORM -t NAME PATH
```

Specifies the target operating system and architecture for the built image. This is crucial for cross-platform builds, such as building an ARM image on an x86 host.

---

## Volume Management

### Create volume

```bash
docker volume create NAME
```

Creates a new, managed Docker volume with a specific NAME. Volumes are the preferred way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.

### List volumes

```bash
docker volume ls
```

Displays a list of all local Docker volumes. It shows the volume name and the driver being used.

### Show volume details

```bash
docker volume inspect NAME
```

Returns low-level, detailed JSON configuration information about a volume. This includes the mount point on the host filesystem and the driver used.

### Remove volume

```bash
docker volume rm NAME
```

Removes one or more specified volumes. A volume can only be removed if it is not currently in use by any container.

### Remove unused volumes

```bash
docker volume prune
```

Removes all local volumes that are not currently referenced by any container. This is a safe cleanup command for removing orphaned volume data.

### Mount named volume

```bash
docker run -v VOLUME:PATH IMAGE
```

Mounts the named Docker VOLUME to the specified PATH inside the container. This is the standard way to ensure data persistence for a container.

### Mount bind volume

```bash
docker run -v HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH IMAGE
```

Binds a directory from the host machine (HOST_PATH) to a path inside the container (CONTAINER_PATH). This is useful for development, allowing the container to access local source code.

### Mount read-only volume

```bash
docker run -v VOLUME:PATH:ro IMAGE
```

Mounts a volume or bind mount to the container's path and sets it as read-only (`:ro`). This prevents the container from writing to the mounted location, enhancing security and data integrity.

### Create anonymous volume

```bash
docker run -v PATH IMAGE
```

Creates an anonymous volume when no volume name is specified, mounting it to the container's PATH. The volume is managed by Docker but has a long, random ID.

### Mount with volume driver

```bash
docker run --mount type=volume,source=VOL,target=PATH IMAGE
```

The newer and more explicit way to mount a volume, using the `--mount` flag. This syntax is often preferred as it is more verbose and clearer than the `-v` shorthand.

---

## Network Management

### List networks

```bash
docker network ls
```

Displays a list of all local Docker networks (e.g., bridge, host, none, and custom networks). It shows the network ID, name, and driver.

### Create network

```bash
docker network create NAME
```

Creates a new, user-defined network with a specified NAME. Containers on the same user-defined network can resolve each other by name.

### Create with driver

```bash
docker network create --driver DRIVER NAME
```

Creates a network using a specific type of network DRIVER (e.g., bridge, overlay). The overlay driver is used for multi-host networking in a Swarm cluster.

### Create with subnet

```bash
docker network create --subnet CIDR NAME
```

Creates a network and specifies the IP address range for the network using CIDR notation. This allows for fine-tuning the IP addressing within the network.

### Create with gateway

```bash
docker network create --gateway IP NAME
```

Specifies the default gateway IP address for the newly created network. This gives greater control over the networking configuration.

### Show network details

```bash
docker network inspect NAME
```

Returns low-level, detailed JSON configuration information about a network. It includes the subnet, gateway, driver, and a list of all connected containers.

### Remove network

```bash
docker network rm NAME
```

Removes one or more specified networks. A network can only be removed if there are no containers currently attached to it.

### Remove unused networks

```bash
docker network prune
```

Removes all local, user-defined networks that are not currently in use by any container. This is a simple command for network-related cleanup.

### Connect container to network

```bash
docker network connect NETWORK CONTAINER
```

Attaches a running container to an existing network. A container can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously.

### Connect with IP

```bash
docker network connect --ip IP NETWORK CONTAINER
```

Connects a container to a network and assigns it a specific static IP address. This is useful for applications that require predictable IP addresses.

### Connect with alias

```bash
docker network connect --alias ALIAS NETWORK CONTAINER
```

Assigns a network-scoped alias to a container on the specified network. Other containers on that network can then resolve the container by this ALIAS name.

### Disconnect container

```bash
docker network disconnect NETWORK CONTAINER
```

Removes a container from a specified network. This can be done on a running container without stopping it.

### Run on specific network

```bash
docker run --network NAME IMAGE
```

Runs a new container and connects it to a specified network immediately upon creation. If this is omitted, the container defaults to the bridge network.

### Run with network alias

```bash
docker run --network-alias ALIAS IMAGE
```

Runs a container and sets a network alias that other containers on the same network can use for service discovery. This is a quick way to establish name resolution for the new container.

---

## Registry & Authentication

### Login to registry

```bash
docker login
```

Logs in to the default public registry (Docker Hub). It prompts you for your username and password.

### Login to custom registry

```bash
docker login REGISTRY
```

Logs in to a private or custom registry specified by the REGISTRY URL. This is necessary for pulling and pushing images to non-Docker Hub locations.

### Login with credentials

```bash
docker login -u USER -p PASS
```

Logs in using the provided username (`-u`) and password (`-p`). Using `-p` is discouraged for security reasons in interactive shells.

### Logout from registry

```bash
docker logout
```

Logs out from the default or specified registry. This clears the local credentials stored for the registry.

### Pull from custom registry

```bash
docker pull REGISTRY/IMAGE
```

Pulls an image from a non-Docker Hub registry by including the REGISTRY prefix in the image name. The local host must be logged in to this registry first.

### Push to custom registry

```bash
docker push REGISTRY/IMAGE
```

Pushes an image to a non-Docker Hub registry. The image must be correctly tagged, and the local host must be logged in.

### Tag for registry

```bash
docker tag IMAGE REGISTRY/IMAGE:TAG
```

Creates a new tag for a local image that includes the full registry path and a TAG. This is the required step before you can push the image to a private registry.

---

## Docker Compose

### Start services

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Reads the `docker-compose.yml` file, builds or pulls images, and creates and starts all defined services. It runs containers in the foreground and displays the aggregated logs.

### Start in background

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Starts all services in the background (detached mode). This is the most common way to run a multi-container application in production or a long-running environment.

### Stop services

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Stops running containers and removes the containers, networks, and default volumes created by `up`. This is the standard command for cleaning up a Compose deployment.

### Stop and remove volumes

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

Performs the standard down cleanup but also explicitly removes the named volumes defined in the Compose file. This permanently deletes persistent data, so use with caution.

### Build services

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Builds or re-builds the images for all services that specify a build context in the Compose file. This only executes the build step and does not start the containers.

### Build without cache

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

Forces the build process to ignore any existing build cache for the services. This ensures a fresh, clean build, often used for troubleshooting.

### List services

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

Displays a list of all containers created by the Compose project. It provides status, command, and port information for all running and stopped services.

### View logs

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

Displays the aggregated log output for all services in the project. This is the best way to monitor the startup and runtime output of your application.

### Follow logs

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Streams the log output from all services in real-time. This is similar to `docker logs -f` but aggregates across all services in the file.

### Execute command

```bash
docker-compose exec SERVICE COMMAND
```

Runs a command inside a container for a running service (e.g., running a database migration). This command is analogous to `docker exec`.

### Run one-off command

```bash
docker-compose run SERVICE COMMAND
```

Runs a one-off command in a new container for a service definition. This is ideal for administrative tasks or tasks that should run and exit (e.g., Django's manage.py runserver).

### Start services

```bash
docker-compose start
```

Starts existing stopped containers that were created by `docker-compose up`. This is useful for resuming a project without re-creating all resources.

### Stop services

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

Stops running containers but does not remove them or their networks/volumes. The containers remain on the system and can be restarted later.

### Restart services

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

Stops and then restarts existing containers for the specified services. This is a convenient way to apply configuration changes that only require a restart.

### Pause services

```bash
docker-compose pause
```

Suspends all processes in the running service containers. The containers remain in memory but their processes are frozen.

### Unpause services

```bash
docker-compose unpause
```

Resumes the processes in paused service containers. This reverses the effect of the pause command.

### Remove stopped containers

```bash
docker-compose rm
```

Removes all stopped containers for the project. It is an alternative to `down` if you only want to clear containers and keep networks/volumes.

### Pull service images

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

Pulls the latest versions of the images referenced in the Compose file from the registry. This updates your local images without starting the containers.

### Push service images

```bash
docker-compose push
```

Pushes the local images for all services to the configured registry. Requires the images to be tagged with the registry prefix.

### Validate compose file

```bash
docker-compose config
```

Validates the Compose file syntax and displays the final, normalized configuration. This is useful for debugging and ensuring your file is correctly interpreted.

### Scale services

```bash
docker-compose up --scale SERVICE=NUM
```

Scales a service up or down to the specified number of running instances. This is a quick way to horizontally scale an application on a single host.

### Show running processes

```bash
docker-compose top
```

Displays the running processes within the service containers. This is an aggregated version of the `docker top` command for the entire project.

---

## System Management

### Show Docker info

```bash
docker info
```

Displays detailed information about the Docker installation and environment. It includes details on storage driver, kernel version, number of images/containers, and available memory.

### Show Docker version

```bash
docker version
```

Shows the version information for the Docker Client and the Docker Engine (Daemon). This is essential for checking compatibility and troubleshooting version issues.

### Show disk usage

```bash
docker system df
```

Displays the disk space usage consumed by Docker images, containers, local volumes, and build cache. It gives a clear overview of how much disk space Docker is utilizing.

### Remove unused data

```bash
docker system prune
```

Removes unused containers, networks, dangling images, and build cache. This is the main command for general Docker system cleanup and reclaiming disk space.

### Remove all unused data

```bash
docker system prune -a
```

Removes all of the above, plus all non-dangling images that are not referenced by any running container. This performs a much more aggressive cleanup.

### Remove with volumes

```bash
docker system prune --volumes
```

Adds unused local volumes to the list of items to be removed during the prune. This can free up a significant amount of space but permanently removes persistent data.

### Show real-time events

```bash
docker events
```

Streams real-time events from the Docker daemon to your terminal. This is used for monitoring container, image, volume, and network activity as it happens.

### Filter events

```bash
docker events --filter event=TYPE
```

Filters the streamed events to only display events of a specific TYPE (e.g., container, image, die). This helps in focusing the monitoring on relevant activities.

### Events since time

```bash
docker events --since TIME
```

Shows all events that have occurred since a specified TIME. This is useful for reviewing a history of events that occurred during a specific period.

---

## Swarm Management

### Initialize swarm

```bash
docker swarm init
```

Initializes a new Docker Swarm on the current machine, making it a Swarm manager. This starts the orchestration capabilities of Docker.

### Initialize with advertise address

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr IP
```

Initializes the Swarm and specifies the IP address the manager node advertises to other nodes. This is crucial in multi-homed or cloud environments for proper cluster communication.

### Join as worker

```bash
docker swarm join --token TOKEN IP:PORT
```

Connects the current machine to an existing Swarm as a worker node. Worker nodes receive and execute tasks but do not participate in cluster management decisions.

### Join as manager

```bash
docker swarm join --token TOKEN IP:PORT
```

Connects the current machine to an existing Swarm as an additional manager node. Multiple managers provide high availability for the control plane.

### Leave swarm

```bash
docker swarm leave
```

Removes the current machine from the Swarm cluster. If run on a manager, it loses its manager privileges.

### Force leave swarm

```bash
docker swarm leave -f
```

Forces a manager node to leave the Swarm, even if it is the only remaining manager. This is used when a node needs to be decommissioned without consensus.

### Show join token

```bash
docker swarm join-token worker
```

Displays the join command and token that a new machine needs to run to join the Swarm as a worker. This token is used for secure authentication.

### Show manager token

```bash
docker swarm join-token manager
```

Displays the join command and token that a new machine needs to run to join the Swarm as a manager. This token should be kept secure.

### Update swarm

```bash
docker swarm update
```

Updates the configuration of the Swarm cluster. This can be used to set parameters like the task history limit or the auto-lock setting.

### Unlock swarm

```bash
docker swarm unlock
```

Unlocks the Swarm cluster after it has been explicitly locked by `docker swarm update --autolock`. This requires the unlock key and is part of a security measure.

### Show unlock key

```bash
docker swarm unlock-key
```

Displays the unlock key that is required to manually unlock a locked Swarm. This key should be securely backed up immediately after enabling auto-lock.

---

## Stack Management

### Deploy stack

```bash
docker stack deploy -c FILE STACK
```

Deploys a multi-service application (a Stack) to the Swarm using a Compose file. This command converts the Compose file into Swarm Services.

### List stacks

```bash
docker stack ls
```

Lists all of the currently deployed Stacks on the Swarm. It shows the stack name and the number of services running in each stack.

### List stack services

```bash
docker stack services STACK
```

Lists the individual Swarm services that make up a specified stack. It provides details like the service ID, name, and desired replicas.

### List stack tasks

```bash
docker stack ps STACK
```

Lists the tasks (running containers) associated with a stack's services. This is used to monitor the state and location of the running application containers.

### Remove stack

```bash
docker stack rm STACK
```

Removes an entire stack from the Swarm. This gracefully stops and removes all the services and tasks defined in the stack.

---

## Service Management

### Create service

```bash
docker service create IMAGE
```

Creates a new Swarm service from an image. A service is the definition of a desired state for one or more tasks (containers).

### List services

```bash
docker service ls
```

Displays a list of all currently running Swarm services. It shows the service name, mode (replicated/global), and replica status.

### Show service details

```bash
docker service inspect SERVICE
```

Returns low-level, detailed JSON configuration information about a service. This includes the service's update policy, replicas, and network configuration.

### Show service logs

```bash
docker service logs SERVICE
```

Aggregates and streams the logs from all the tasks (containers) belonging to a service. This is the primary way to monitor a deployed service in a Swarm.

### List service tasks

```bash
docker service ps SERVICE
```

Lists the individual tasks (containers) that belong to a service. It shows where each task is running and its current state.

### Scale service

```bash
docker service scale SERVICE=NUM
```

Changes the number of running replicas for a service. Docker Swarm will automatically scale the service up or down to match the new desired NUM.

### Update service

```bash
docker service update SERVICE
```

Updates the configuration of a service (e.g., resource limits, network settings). Docker Swarm will roll out the changes gracefully to the running tasks.

### Update image

```bash
docker service update --image IMAGE SERVICE
```

Updates a service to use a new image version. Swarm initiates a rolling update, replacing old tasks with new ones without downtime.

### Remove service

```bash
docker service rm SERVICE
```

Removes a running service from the Swarm. This stops and removes all associated tasks and their containers.

### Rollback service

```bash
docker service rollback SERVICE
```

Reverts a service to its previous configuration. This is used when a new update is causing issues and you need a quick way to restore stability.

---

## Node Management

### List nodes

```bash
docker node ls
```

Lists all the nodes (machines) participating in the Swarm cluster. It displays the node ID, hostname, status, and role (manager/worker).

### Show node details

```bash
docker node inspect NODE
```

Returns detailed JSON information about a specific node. This includes the node's labels, status, availability, and resource specifications.

### Update node

```bash
docker node update NODE
```

Updates the configuration of a node, often used to add or update labels. Labels are used by the Swarm scheduler to constrain service placement.

### Promote to manager

```bash
docker node promote NODE
```

Changes a worker node's role to a manager node. This is used to add more managers for high availability.

### Demote to worker

```bash
docker node demote NODE
```

Changes a manager node's role back to a worker node. This is used when you need to reduce the number of managers in the cluster.

### Remove node

```bash
docker node rm NODE
```

Removes a node from the Swarm cluster. The node must first be drained or explicitly forced to leave.

### List node tasks

```bash
docker node ps NODE
```

Lists all the tasks (containers) that are currently running on a specific node. This is useful for debugging and checking the workload distribution.

### Set node availability

```bash
docker node update --availability active|pause|drain NODE
```

Sets the scheduling status of a node, allowing or preventing the Swarm from deploying new tasks to it. `drain` is used to gracefully move all existing tasks off a node.

---

## Secret Management

### Create secret from file

```bash
docker secret create NAME FILE
```

Creates a new Swarm Secret from the contents of a local FILE. Secrets are securely distributed to only the services that need them.

### Create secret from stdin

```bash
echo "data" | docker secret create NAME -
```

Creates a new Swarm Secret from data piped in via standard input (`-`). This is useful for creating secrets non-interactively in scripts.

### List secrets

```bash
docker secret ls
```

Lists all the secrets stored securely in the Swarm cluster. It provides the secret ID, name, and creation time.

### Show secret details

```bash
docker secret inspect NAME
```

Returns detailed JSON information about a secret (metadata only, not the secret content). This is a utility command for inspecting configuration.

### Remove secret

```bash
docker secret rm NAME
```

Removes a secret from the Swarm cluster. Any service currently using the secret will lose access to it, potentially causing errors.

---

## Config Management

### Create config from file

```bash
docker config create NAME FILE
```

Creates a new Swarm Config from the contents of a local FILE. Configs are securely distributed configuration files that are read-only for services.

### Create config from stdin

```bash
echo "data" | docker config create NAME -
```

Creates a new Swarm Config from data piped in via standard input (`-`). This is useful for creating small config fragments or for use in scripts.

### List configs

```bash
docker config ls
```

Lists all the configs stored in the Swarm cluster. It provides the config ID, name, and creation time.

### Show config details

```bash
docker config inspect NAME
```

Returns detailed JSON information about a config (metadata only, not the config content). This is used to check the config's ID, date, and size.

### Remove config

```bash
docker config rm NAME
```

Removes a config from the Swarm cluster. Services that were using the config will stop and fail to restart correctly if they still require it.

## Plugin Management (Continued)

### Upgrade plugin

```bash
docker plugin upgrade PLUGIN
```

Upgrades an installed plugin to a newer version. This automatically handles the necessary stop/start cycle.

### Push plugin

```bash
docker plugin push PLUGIN
```

Pushes a locally created plugin to a registry. This is used by plugin developers to distribute their extensions.

### Create plugin

```bash
docker plugin create PLUGIN PATH
```

Creates a new plugin from a root filesystem and configuration located in PATH. This is a developer-focused command for packaging a new plugin.

### Configure plugin

```bash
docker plugin set PLUGIN KEY=VALUE
```

Sets configuration values for a specific plugin. This is used to fine-tune the plugin's behavior after installation.

---

## Context Management

### List contexts

```bash
docker context ls
```

Lists all the stored Docker contexts. A context defines the endpoint (local daemon, remote server, or cloud provider) that Docker commands run against.

### Create context

```bash
docker context create NAME
```

Creates a new Docker context, typically pointing to a remote daemon. This allows you to easily switch between different Docker hosts.

### Use context

```bash
docker context use NAME
```

Switches the current shell's Docker environment to use the specified context. All subsequent docker commands will execute against the target defined by NAME.

### Show context details

```bash
docker context inspect NAME
```

Returns detailed JSON information about a specific context. This shows the endpoint and connection details for the target.

### Update context

```bash
docker context update NAME
```

Modifies the connection details or metadata for an existing context. This allows changing the target endpoint without creating a new context.

### Remove context

```bash
docker context rm NAME
```

Removes a specified context. This only removes the local configuration; it does not affect the remote daemon.

### Export context

```bash
docker context export NAME
```

Saves a context's configuration to a file. This allows for easy sharing or backup of a context configuration.

### Import context

```bash
docker context import NAME FILE
```

Imports a context configuration from a specified file. This allows the use of contexts that have been shared or backed up.

---

## Builder Management

### List builders

```bash
docker builder ls
```

Lists all the available build instances. These instances manage build concurrency and cache.

### Prune build cache

```bash
docker builder prune
```

Removes the cached data used by the builder instances. This is useful for freeing up disk space consumed by intermediate build layers.

### Show builder disk usage

```bash
docker builder du
```

Displays a breakdown of the disk space consumed by the build cache. This helps in identifying large or unused cache segments.

---

## Trust & Content Trust

### Sign and push image

```bash
docker trust sign IMAGE:TAG
```

Uses a private key to digitally sign an image and then pushes it to the registry. This confirms the image's origin and integrity.

### Show trust data

```bash
docker trust inspect IMAGE
```

Displays the signers and trust information for an image in the registry. This confirms whether an image has been signed and by whom.

### Revoke trust

```bash
docker trust revoke IMAGE:TAG
```

Removes the digital signature for a specified image from the registry. This is used to invalidate a signed image.

### Generate trust key

```bash
docker trust key generate NAME
```

Generates a new cryptographic key pair (private and public) for signing images. The private key is used for signing, and the public key is used for verification.

### Load trust key

```bash
docker trust key load FILE
```

Adds a private key from a file to the local user's trust repository. This allows the user to sign images using the imported key.

### Add signer

```bash
docker trust signer add --key FILE SIGNER REPO
```

Adds a signer (user/key) to a repository, allowing that key to sign images for that repository. The FILE points to the public key of the new signer.

### Remove signer

```bash
docker trust signer remove SIGNER REPO
```

Removes a signer's public key from a repository. The removed signer can no longer sign images for that repository.

---

## Checkpoint Management

### Create checkpoint

```bash
docker checkpoint create CONTAINER NAME
```

Creates a checkpoint (a snapshot of the running container's state) using CRIU. This allows the container to be restored to that exact state later.

### List checkpoints

```bash
docker checkpoint ls CONTAINER
```

Lists all the checkpoints created for a specific container. This shows the available restoration points.

### Remove checkpoint

```bash
docker checkpoint rm CONTAINER NAME
```

Deletes a specific checkpoint for a container. This removes the snapshot data from the host filesystem.

---

## Manifest Management

### Inspect manifest

```bash
docker manifest inspect IMAGE
```

Displays the manifest list or manifest for a multi-architecture image. This shows which architectures and operating systems the image supports.

### Create manifest

```bash
docker manifest create LIST IMAGE...
```

Creates a manifest list that references multiple architecture-specific images. This is used to create a single, multi-platform image name.

### Push manifest

```bash
docker manifest push LIST
```

Pushes the newly created manifest list to the registry. This makes the multi-architecture image available for platforms to automatically pull the correct image.

### Annotate manifest

```bash
docker manifest annotate LIST IMAGE --os OS --arch ARCH
```

Adds or updates metadata (like OS or architecture) for an image within a manifest list. This ensures proper platform selection when pulling the multi-arch image.

---

## Container Cleanup

### Remove all stopped containers

```bash
docker container prune
```

Removes all exited or stopped containers. This is a quick way to clean up resources from terminated container runs.

### Remove containers older than

```bash
docker container prune --filter "until=24h"
```

Removes stopped containers that have been inactive for longer than the specified time (e.g., 24 hours). This allows for a targeted cleanup of old resources.

### Remove with label filter

```bash
docker container prune --filter "label=KEY"
```

Removes stopped containers based on whether they have a specific label assigned to them. This enables filtering by custom metadata.

---

## Image Cleanup

### Remove dangling images

```bash
docker image prune
```

Removes only the dangling images (those that are not tagged and not referenced by any container). This is the safest cleanup of unneeded image layers.

### Remove all unused images

```bash
docker image prune -a
```

Removes all unused images, including intermediate and non-dangling images not referenced by a container. This is a powerful command that frees up significant disk space.

### Remove images older than

```bash
docker image prune -a --filter "until=24h"
```

Removes all unused images that were created or last modified longer than the specified time (e.g., 24 hours) ago. This provides an age-based policy for image cleanup.

---

## Volume Cleanup

### Remove all unused volumes

```bash
docker volume prune
```

Removes all local volumes that are not currently referenced by any container. This is the standard, single command for safely removing orphaned volume data.

### Remove with filter

```bash
docker volume prune --filter "label=KEY"
```

Removes unused volumes that have a specific label assigned to them. This allows for targeted removal of volumes based on custom metadata.

---

## Network Cleanup

### Remove all unused networks

```bash
docker network prune
```

Removes all local, user-defined networks that are not currently in use by any container. This is a quick way to clean up orphaned network configurations.

### Remove with filter

```bash
docker network prune --filter "until=24h"
```

Removes unused networks that were created longer than the specified time (e.g., 24 hours) ago. This helps maintain a clean network environment based on age.

---

## Common Run Options

### Run with port mapping

```bash
docker run -p HOST:CONTAINER IMAGE
```

Maps a port from the container (CONTAINER) to a port on the host machine (HOST). This allows external access to the service running inside the container.

### Run with environment variable

```bash
docker run -e KEY=VALUE IMAGE
```

Sets an environment variable inside the container. This is a primary method for configuring applications at runtime.

### Run with multiple env vars

```bash
docker run -e KEY1=VAL1 -e KEY2=VAL2 IMAGE
```

Sets multiple environment variables for the container's environment. The `-e` flag must be repeated for each variable.

### Run with env file

```bash
docker run --env-file FILE IMAGE
```

Sets environment variables using key-value pairs listed in a FILE. This is a cleaner way to pass a large number of variables.

### Run with working directory

```bash
docker run -w PATH IMAGE
```

Sets the working directory inside the container where the primary command will be executed. This is useful for commands that expect to run from a specific location.

### Run as specific user

```bash
docker run -u USER IMAGE
```

Runs the container's primary process with a specified USER or UID/GID. This is an important security feature to avoid running as the root user.

### Run with hostname

```bash
docker run -h HOSTNAME IMAGE
```

Sets the hostname for the container. This value is often used by the application for identification or logging purposes.

### Run with CPU limit

```bash
docker run --cpus NUM IMAGE
```

Limits the container's access to the host's CPU resources to a specific number of cores. This is a crucial command for resource governance and preventing a container from hogging the CPU.

### Run with memory limit

```bash
docker run -m SIZE IMAGE
```

Limits the container's access to the host's memory to a specific SIZE (e.g., 512m, 1g). This prevents a memory leak in one container from crashing the entire host.

### Run with privileged mode

```bash
docker run --privileged IMAGE
```

Gives the container full access to the host's devices and kernel capabilities. This should be used with extreme caution as it breaks container isolation.

### Run with cap add

```bash
docker run --cap-add CAPABILITY IMAGE
```

Adds a specific Linux CAPABILITY to the container's set of privileges. This grants fine-grained access to kernel features without using the full `--privileged` flag.

### Run with cap drop

```bash
docker run --cap-drop CAPABILITY IMAGE
```

Removes a specific Linux CAPABILITY from the container's set of privileges. This is used to further reduce the security attack surface.

### Run with device

```bash
docker run --device PATH IMAGE
```

Adds a host device (e.g., a GPU, or a serial port) to the container. This is necessary for containers that need to interact directly with hardware.

### Run with restart policy

```bash
docker run --restart=always IMAGE
```

Sets the restart policy for the container (e.g., always, on-failure). `always` ensures the container restarts automatically whenever it exits.

### Run with label

```bash
docker run -l KEY=VALUE IMAGE
```

Adds metadata (a label) to the container. Labels are often used for organization, monitoring, or automating cleanup scripts.

### Run with link

```bash
docker run --link CONTAINER IMAGE
```

**DEPRECATED:** Links a container to another via the legacy network mechanism. Modern practice uses user-defined networks for DNS resolution instead.

### Run with DNS

```bash
docker run --dns IP IMAGE
```

Configures a custom DNS server IP for the container to use for name resolution. This overrides the host's default DNS settings.

### Run with add-host

```bash
docker run --add-host HOST:IP IMAGE
```

Adds an entry to the container's `/etc/hosts` file. This is useful for custom host-to-IP mappings inside the container's environment.

### Run with pid mode

```bash
docker run --pid host IMAGE
```

Allows the container to share the PID namespace with the host system. This lets the container see all processes running on the host, which is a significant security risk but necessary for some monitoring tools.

### Run with IPC mode

```bash
docker run --ipc host IMAGE
```

Allows the container to share the IPC namespace with the host system. This enables inter-process communication between the container and processes on the host.
